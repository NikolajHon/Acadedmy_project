# Learning application
This application will be targeted at the Operating Systems subject commissioned by the university to facilitate student learning. This application will have different roles in it such as “Student” and “Teacher”. This app will have lesson materials available, quizzes for each lesson and lots of practice with CodeWars type tasks where students will be able to consolidate their knowledge. There will also be a rating of the best students and a forum where students and teachers will be able to share experiences and help each other with different problems that students will have during their studies. Teachers will be able to create new assignments, tests and add new materials.
